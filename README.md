# cub3d
## Description
This project is inspired by the famous 90â€™s game Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever. The aim of the project is to explore ray-casting and create a dynamic view inside a maze.

As a graphic design project, cub3d teaches the handling of: windows, colors, events, images, textures, sprites, file parsing etc. It is also a remarkable playground to explore the practical applications of mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms
## Usage
To compile the game, run:

`make`

To run the game, use:

`./cub3d <path to map file>`

If you run the game with `./cub3d <path to map file> --save`. The game will not start, instead it will save the first rendered image in `bmp` format.
